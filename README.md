# Linux post installation script

This script automates the installation and setup of a bunch of programs in Linux

- Installs VScode and changes settings
- Installs Oh my zsh and customizes .zshrc
- Adds shell alias and sets the default shell
- ~Installs Gnome shell extensions like "dash to panel" and "clipboard indicator"~ (WIP)

~It has 3 modes: `rootless`, `full` and `simple`~ (WIP)

## Usage

```
curl -sL andrexandre.github.io | sh
```
> -L = automatically follow the redirect, -s = silent (don't show progress meter)
