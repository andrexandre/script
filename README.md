# Linux setup script

This script automates the installation and setup of a bunch of programs in Linux

- Installs VScode and changes settings
- Installs Oh my zsh and customizes .zshrc
- Adds shell alias and sets the default shell

It has 2 modes that install everything with or without root

## Usage
