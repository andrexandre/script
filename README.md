# Post installation script

This script automates the installation and setup of a bunch of programs in Ubuntu

~It has 3 modes: `rootless`, `full` and `simple`~ (WIP)

- Installs VScode and changes settings
- Installs Oh my zsh and customizes .zshrc
- Installs Gnome shell extensions like "dash to panel" and "clipboard indicator" (WIP)
- Adds shell alias and sets the default shell

## Usage

```
wget -qO- tinyurl.com/qwsdWQSD | bash
```
> -q = quiet, -O- = redirect to the standard output

> [!NOTE]
> To see the script without running it, remove `| bash` from the command \
> To download the script to a file, remove the flags from wget
