# Post installation script

This script automates the installation and setup of a bunch of programs in Ubuntu

## Features (WIP)

It has 3 types of modes: `rootless`, `full` and `simple` and the following features:

- Installs VScode and changes settings
- Installs Oh my zsh and changes .zshrc
- Installs Gnome shell extensions (dash to panel and clipboard indicator)
- Adds alias and sets the default shell

## How to use

```
wget -O- tinyurl.com/qwsdWQSD | bash
```

> the -O- is to redirect to the standard output

## Download the script
```
wget -qO script tinyurl.com/qwsdWQSD
chmod +x script
```
> -q = quiet and -O specify a name
